## ðŸ¤– Computer Vision
### Vehicle Detection with CNN

A series of notebooks to dive deep into popular datasets for object detection and learn how to train Detectron2 on custom datasets.

After i  preprocessed a dataset of Customer Analysis and built machine learning models to predict cluster which the customer belongs to. I built an interactive user interface with flask and html.

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://chriskhanhtran.github.io/minimal-portfolio/projects/ames-house-price.html)

I performed comprehensive EDA to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict house prices. My best model had Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12293.919, ranking **95/15502**, approximately **top 0.6%** in the Kaggle leaderboard.

### Predict Breast Cancer with RF, PCA and SVM using Python

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://chriskhanhtran.github.io/minimal-portfolio/projects/breast-cancer.html)

In this project I am going to perform comprehensive EDA on the breast cancer dataset, then transform the data using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and use Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a patient has breast cancer.

### Business Analytics Conference 2018: How is NYC's Government Using Money?

[![Open Research Poster](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Open_Research_Poster-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)](https://chriskhanhtran.github.io/minimal-portfolio/pdf/bac2018.pdf)

In three-month research and a two-day hackathon, I led a team of four students to discover insights from 6 million records of NYC and Boston government spending data sets and won runner-up prize for the best research poster out of 18 participating colleges.
