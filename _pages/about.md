## Hobbies
### Photography
I've always loved looking at the stars and capturing beautiful moments. My passion for photography helps me express stories without words.

### Long Distance Running
Running helps me reflect and challenge myself. Inspired by Haruki Murakami's writings, I use running as both exercise and meditation.

> "As I run I tell myself to think of a river. And clouds. But essentially I'm not thinking of a thing. All I do is keep on running in my own cozy, homemade void, my own nostalgic silence..."
